# Kidney-Disease-Classification-Deep-Learning-Project

## Project Description

Kidney tumors are growths in the kidneys that can be benign or cancerous. Most do not cause symptoms, and are discovered unexpectedly when being diagnosed.

**This project aims to classify kidney tumors as benign or cancerous using machine learning techniques on Kidney CT Scan images.**
